# TODO — Helper Agent (embedded BYOK ontology chat panel)

Progress tracker for `helper_agent_plan.md`. Same convention as the base app's `TODO.md`: check items
off as work happens, log deviations/decisions with a dated entry, keep "Current State" accurate enough
that this can be picked up cold. This branch (`helper_agent`) is a standalone subproject and is never
merged into `main` — see `helper_agent_plan.md` §0.

---

## Current State

- **Phase:** Phase 1 (panel scaffold + BYOK connect modal + live model list) is implemented, tested, and
  green. Phases 2–6 (see `helper_agent_plan.md` §6) are not started.
- **Test suite:** `tests/helper-agent-phase1.spec.mjs` — 11 tests, all mocking the OpenAI API via
  `page.route()` (no real network calls, no API key needed). Full repo suite: 298 JS tests, all green,
  run twice consecutively.
- **What Phase 1 built:** the collapsed-by-default `#agent-panel` (toggle fixed to the left edge), the
  two-stage `#agent-connect-overlay` modal (stage 1: enter API key → live `GET /v1/models` call, which
  doubles as the real-world CORS check per plan §3; stage 2: review/override the heuristically
  preselected newest-reasoning-model, then confirm), BYOK persistence (unchecked-by-default in-memory
  key, opt-in `localStorage` under `kg-agent-key`/`kg-agent-model`, a "forget saved key" action),
  disconnect, and bilingual (en/hu) strings for all of it. The connected panel shows the model picker
  and an empty, disabled chat input/send — live conversation is Phase 2, not this phase.
- **`window.__kg.agent`** exposes the same test-introspection surface the rest of the app already
  follows: `state`, `isExpanded`/`setExpanded`, `openConnectModal`/`closeConnectModal`/`submitConnect`,
  `disconnect`, `forgetStoredKey`/`hasStoredKey`, `pickDefaultModel` (+ the two heuristic predicates it's
  built from), `getConnectErrorKind`.

## Phase 1 — Panel scaffold + connect modal + model list

- [x] Collapsed/expanded panel state machine (`#agent-panel`, `agentState.panelExpanded`).
- [x] Connect modal: key input, live `GET /v1/models`, heuristic default model
      (`pickDefaultAgentModel` — newest `o[0-9]*`/`*think*`/`*reason*` id, falling back to the newest
      non-audio/image/embedding/moderation id if none match), manual override before confirming.
- [x] BYOK persistence: unchecked "remember" by default (in-memory only), opt-in `localStorage`,
      pre-fill on next modal open, explicit "forget saved key" action.
- [x] Disconnect action resets `agentState` and the connected/disconnected UI.
- [x] Bilingual (en/hu) `STRINGS` entries + `applyAgentLanguage()`, including re-rendering the last
      connect error by *kind* (not pre-rendered text) so a language toggle mid-error doesn't leave a
      stale-language message on screen.
- [x] Error handling: empty key, invalid key (401), generic non-2xx, network/CORS failure — each a
      distinct, testable `agentConnectErrorKind`.
- [x] Tests: `tests/helper-agent-phase1.spec.mjs`, all OpenAI calls mocked via `page.route()`.

### Log

**2026-07-28 — Phase 1 implemented.** Built per `helper_agent_plan.md` as revised after the user's
second feedback round (prompt hardening, long-context summarization, language lock, and live model
listing were folded into the plan before this phase started — see that document's own revision history
for the reasoning). Two notable implementation decisions made along the way, not explicitly spelled out
in the plan text itself:

- The connect modal became a genuine **two-stage** flow (enter key → fetch models → review/override →
  confirm) rather than a single submit, because the plan's "manually overridable" model requirement is
  only meaningful if the user can see the live-fetched list *before* the connection is finalized, not
  only after. The submit button's label changes (`Connect` → `Confirm model & connect`) to reflect the
  stage.
- `populateAgentModelSelects()` builds `<option>` elements via `createElement`/`textContent` (mirroring
  the existing Domain Model dialog's own `ruleOptions` population pattern), not an interpolated HTML
  string — model ids come back from a live API response and get the same "don't build HTML from
  external strings" treatment as the chat transcript will in Phase 2 (plan §4.7).
- A real (non-`curl`) CORS spike was attempted with a Playwright-launched Chromium against the actual
  `api.openai.com`, proxy explicitly configured and TLS errors ignored. It failed with
  `net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` at the network layer — while `curl` through the identical proxy, at the
  same time, succeeded — isolating the failure to this sandbox's own browser/proxy tunneling rather than
  a CORS answer either way. See `helper_agent_plan.md` §3 for the full writeup; the connect modal's own
  live `/v1/models` call remains the real-world check, run by actual users outside this sandbox.
- One pre-existing test (`tests/ui-polish.spec.mjs`'s theme/armed-button-border test) flaked once under
  full-suite load during this pass; it passed cleanly both in isolation and on a full-suite rerun
  immediately after, and is unrelated to any change made here (unmodified CSS/logic in that area) — not
  logged further, since the project already has a documented history of this test class flaking under
  load (see the base app's own `TODO.md`).
