## Heuristic (regex/token-overlap) metrics

Two denominators, side by side: **full domain** is every class/relationship/property in the ground truth's 57-class comprehensive reference model; **practical scope** is the subset the ground truth's own canonical competency questions and actions actually talk about (see tests/evals/README.md) -- the ceiling a real, single-session, competency-driven interview could reach even with perfect elicitation. Full-domain numbers give context and cross-run comparability; practical-scope numbers are the more meaningful read of interview quality on their own.

| Metric | Full domain | Practical scope | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Recovery effectiveness (composite)** | **0.0%** | **0.0%** | equal-weighted: class F1, relationship F1, property F1, value fidelity |
| Class recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/57 full · 0/24 scoped ground-truth classes matched; 0 recovered |
| Relationship recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/31 full · 0/17 scoped ground-truth relationships matched; 0 recovered (subclass/"is a" predicates excluded from both -- see README) |
| Property recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/49 full · 0/11 scoped ground-truth properties matched; 0 recovered (technical identifier/URI fields excluded — see tests/evals/README.md) |
| Controlled-value fidelity | n/a | n/a | average allowed-value overlap across matched controlled-value properties |

## Semantic (LLM-adjudicated) metrics

Same two denominators, same table shape, computed by `llmMatcher.mjs`'s `computeSemanticRecoveryMetrics()`: the heuristic pass above, plus a strict LLM judge given a second, structured look at every residual near-miss the heuristic pass rejected (a class/relationship/property phrased very differently than gold's hidden wording, or a controlled-value list using a different labeling convention for the same real scale). The judge only ever adds matches the heuristic pass missed -- it never overrides or removes a heuristic match, so this section's numbers are always >= the section above's on every recall metric. Any gap between the two sections is exactly the wording-variance tax the heuristic-only score was paying; a genuinely wrong or missing recovery costs the same in both.

| Metric | Full domain | Practical scope | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Recovery effectiveness (composite)** | **0.0%** | **0.0%** | equal-weighted: class F1, relationship F1, property F1, value fidelity |
| Class recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/57 full · 0/24 scoped ground-truth classes matched; 0 recovered |
| Relationship recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/31 full · 0/17 scoped ground-truth relationships matched; 0 recovered (subclass/"is a" predicates excluded from both -- see README) |
| Property recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/49 full · 0/11 scoped ground-truth properties matched; 0 recovered (technical identifier/URI fields excluded — see tests/evals/README.md) |
| Controlled-value fidelity | n/a | n/a | average allowed-value overlap across matched controlled-value properties |

## Rules and actions (heuristic)

Reported as their own dimensions, not folded into the recovery-effectiveness composite above (issue #105 -- a later issue can define a new composite once enough domains have been run with this data). A rule counts as recovered only when its core decision condition is semantically close to gold's, not merely its name (recoveryMetrics.mjs's `computeRuleMetrics`); an action's identification is separate from whether its input class, preconditions, effect, and verification text were also individually recovered.

| Metric | Value | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Rule recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/7 ground-truth rules matched (core condition equivalence, not name alone); 0 recovered |
| Action identification recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/5 ground-truth actions matched by name/meaning; 0 recovered |
| Action input-class accuracy | n/a | of 0 matched action(s) whose input class itself was recoverable at all |
| Action precondition recovery | n/a (no matched gold action had preconditions) | token-overlap similarity between gold rule conditions and the recovered action's own linked rules, averaged over matched actions that had any |
| Action effect recovery | n/a | token-overlap similarity between gold and recovered effect text |
| Action verification recovery | n/a | token-overlap similarity between gold and recovered verification text |

## Rules and actions (semantic)

Same shape as above, plus a strict LLM judge given a second look at every residual rule/action the heuristic pass didn't match (`llmMatcher.mjs`'s `computeSemanticRuleActionMetrics`). Input-class accuracy and precondition/effect/verification recovery are not themselves semantically re-judged -- only whether the rule/action itself counts as recovered at all is.

| Metric | Value | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Rule recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/7 ground-truth rules matched (core condition equivalence, not name alone); 0 recovered |
| Action identification recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/5 ground-truth actions matched by name/meaning; 0 recovered |
| Action input-class accuracy | n/a | of 0 matched action(s) whose input class itself was recoverable at all |
| Action precondition recovery | n/a (no matched gold action had preconditions) | token-overlap similarity between gold rule conditions and the recovered action's own linked rules, averaged over matched actions that had any |
| Action effect recovery | n/a | token-overlap similarity between gold and recovered effect text |
| Action verification recovery | n/a | token-overlap similarity between gold and recovered verification text |

## LLM review of the conversation

## Errors
- **Turn 1**
  - Speaker/state handling looks wrong: the persona’s opening message from turn 0 is duplicated as **app-user** input, and the assistant treats that as if it came from the user. This suggests transcript plumbing / role-mapping issues.
- **Turn 1**
  - The assistant says “we’re starting from a blank model” based only on “Checked the current ontology state,” without exposing what was actually checked. Could be fine, but reads like an unsupported assumption if the tool returned no visible state details.
- **Turn 2**
  - The assistant says “Please confirm or correct this batch before I record it,” but there is no visible tool call to actually stage or record the competency questions. Not necessarily wrong yet, but the workflow state is opaque.

## Noteworthy observations
- **Turn 1**
  - Good interviewing structure: the assistant sets a phased plan and asks for concrete operational questions first, which is an efficient ontology-elicitation move.
- **Turn 1**
  - The prompt for “8–12 real questions” worked well; the persona gave a rich, domain-grounded list with strong coverage of parties, terms, servicing, collateral, rates, and payment history.
- **Turn 2**
  - Good normalization move: the assistant atomizes bundled questions into more ontology-friendly competency questions.
- **Turn 2**
  - Slight over-expansion: 12 source questions became 27 competency questions. Some splitting is useful, but this may increase confirmation burden and slow the interview.
- **Turn 2**
  - Missed chance to identify likely core entities explicitly before asking for confirmation (e.g., loan/credit facility, party roles, payment schedule, collateral, security agreement, servicing party, payment transaction). That could have reduced the cognitive load of reviewing a long normalized list.
- **Turn 2**
  - Missed an obvious follow-up on terminology: the persona alternates between “loan,” “credit facility,” and “credit agreement.” The assistant preserved all three notions without clarifying whether these are distinct entity types or synonyms.
- **Turn 2**
  - Missed an obvious modeling probe around “who is servicing this loan”: is servicing always an organization, can it change over time, and is the servicer distinct from the payment collector?
- **Turn 2**
  - The assistant didn’t flag temporal/versioning implications that are already apparent from the questions: rates, collateral values, available capacity, and servicing responsibility may all vary over time. That would be a high-value next step.

See `conversation-log.md` in this same directory (overwritten every run alongside this report). Every real apply_ontology_yaml/get_graph_state tool call's exact arguments and results are in `tool-calls.md` alongside it, for verifying any suspected tool/state-sync issue against what was actually sent and returned rather than the interviewer's own narration of it.
