## Heuristic (regex/token-overlap) metrics

Two denominators, side by side: **full domain** is every class/relationship/property in the ground truth's 53-class comprehensive reference model; **practical scope** is the subset the ground truth's own canonical competency questions and actions actually talk about (see tests/evals/README.md) -- the ceiling a real, single-session, competency-driven interview could reach even with perfect elicitation. Full-domain numbers give context and cross-run comparability; practical-scope numbers are the more meaningful read of interview quality on their own.

| Metric | Full domain | Practical scope | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Recovery effectiveness (composite)** | **0.0%** | **0.0%** | equal-weighted: class F1, relationship F1, property F1, value fidelity |
| Class recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/53 full · 0/28 scoped ground-truth classes matched; 0 recovered |
| Relationship recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/30 full · 0/23 scoped ground-truth relationships matched; 0 recovered (subclass/"is a" predicates excluded from both -- see README) |
| Property recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/3 full · 0/2 scoped ground-truth properties matched; 0 recovered (technical identifier/URI fields excluded — see tests/evals/README.md) |
| Controlled-value fidelity | n/a | n/a | average allowed-value overlap across matched controlled-value properties |

## Semantic (LLM-adjudicated) metrics

Same two denominators, same table shape, computed by `llmMatcher.mjs`'s `computeSemanticRecoveryMetrics()`: the heuristic pass above, plus a strict LLM judge given a second, structured look at every residual near-miss the heuristic pass rejected (a class/relationship/property phrased very differently than gold's hidden wording, or a controlled-value list using a different labeling convention for the same real scale). The judge only ever adds matches the heuristic pass missed -- it never overrides or removes a heuristic match, so this section's numbers are always >= the section above's on every recall metric. Any gap between the two sections is exactly the wording-variance tax the heuristic-only score was paying; a genuinely wrong or missing recovery costs the same in both.

| Metric | Full domain | Practical scope | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Recovery effectiveness (composite)** | **0.0%** | **0.0%** | equal-weighted: class F1, relationship F1, property F1, value fidelity |
| Class recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/53 full · 0/28 scoped ground-truth classes matched; 0 recovered |
| Relationship recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/30 full · 0/23 scoped ground-truth relationships matched; 0 recovered (subclass/"is a" predicates excluded from both -- see README) |
| Property recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/3 full · 0/2 scoped ground-truth properties matched; 0 recovered (technical identifier/URI fields excluded — see tests/evals/README.md) |
| Controlled-value fidelity | n/a | n/a | average allowed-value overlap across matched controlled-value properties |

## Rules and actions (heuristic)

Reported as their own dimensions, not folded into the recovery-effectiveness composite above (issue #105 -- a later issue can define a new composite once enough domains have been run with this data). A rule counts as recovered only when its core decision condition is semantically close to gold's, not merely its name (recoveryMetrics.mjs's `computeRuleMetrics`); an action's identification is separate from whether its input class, preconditions, effect, and verification text were also individually recovered.

| Metric | Value | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Rule recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/5 ground-truth rules matched (core condition equivalence, not name alone); 0 recovered |
| Action identification recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/5 ground-truth actions matched by name/meaning; 0 recovered |
| Action input-class accuracy | n/a | of 0 matched action(s) whose input class itself was recoverable at all |
| Action precondition recovery | n/a (no matched gold action had preconditions) | token-overlap similarity between gold rule conditions and the recovered action's own linked rules, averaged over matched actions that had any |
| Action effect recovery | n/a | token-overlap similarity between gold and recovered effect text |
| Action verification recovery | n/a | token-overlap similarity between gold and recovered verification text |

## Rules and actions (semantic)

Same shape as above, plus a strict LLM judge given a second look at every residual rule/action the heuristic pass didn't match (`llmMatcher.mjs`'s `computeSemanticRuleActionMetrics`). Input-class accuracy and precondition/effect/verification recovery are not themselves semantically re-judged -- only whether the rule/action itself counts as recovered at all is.

| Metric | Value | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Rule recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/5 ground-truth rules matched (core condition equivalence, not name alone); 0 recovered |
| Action identification recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/5 ground-truth actions matched by name/meaning; 0 recovered |
| Action input-class accuracy | n/a | of 0 matched action(s) whose input class itself was recoverable at all |
| Action precondition recovery | n/a (no matched gold action had preconditions) | token-overlap similarity between gold rule conditions and the recovered action's own linked rules, averaged over matched actions that had any |
| Action effect recovery | n/a | token-overlap similarity between gold and recovered effect text |
| Action verification recovery | n/a | token-overlap similarity between gold and recovered verification text |

## LLM review of the conversation

## Errors

- **Turn 71:** The recap of the five action rules omitted **receipt**. The persona caught it, and the interviewer corrected the recap at turn 72.
- **Turn 83:** The interviewer said a freight container was “not a separate class,” losing the expert’s distinction that it is a **more specific kind of container**. The persona corrected this at turn 84.
- **Turns 96–97:** The interviewer asked the persona for a live ontology export despite repeatedly saying it could not access the canvas. Neither party could provide it, so the saved model and final validation remained unverified.

## Noteworthy observations

- **Turns 2–10, 25–42:** The interviewer carefully separated shipments from processes, places from parties, and confirmed direct links from operational associations whose evidence paths were unknown. This avoided inventing ontology connections.
- **Turns 79–96:** A bounded check uncovered four useful additional questions about purchase orders, items, and containers without turning them into unnecessary action prerequisites.
- **Turns 97–113:** After agreeing the draft was at a stopping point, the interviewer resumed a lengthy lookup-cardinality review. It yielded useful distinctions—especially at turn 111, where matching endpoints alone proved insufficient to say a shipment was being prepared—but would have been more efficient before the stopping-point recap.

## Full conversation log

See `conversation-log.md` in this same directory (overwritten every run alongside this report). Every real apply_ontology_yaml/get_graph_state tool call's exact arguments and results are in `tool-calls.md` alongside it, for verifying any suspected tool/state-sync issue against what was actually sent and returned rather than the interviewer's own narration of it.
