## Heuristic (regex/token-overlap) metrics

Two denominators, side by side: **full domain** is every class/relationship/property in the ground truth's 68-class comprehensive reference model; **practical scope** is the subset the ground truth's own canonical competency questions and actions actually talk about (see tests/evals/README.md) -- the ceiling a real, single-session, competency-driven interview could reach even with perfect elicitation. Full-domain numbers give context and cross-run comparability; practical-scope numbers are the more meaningful read of interview quality on their own.

| Metric | Full domain | Practical scope | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Recovery effectiveness (composite)** | **0.0%** | **0.0%** | equal-weighted: class F1, relationship F1, property F1, value fidelity |
| Class recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/68 full · 0/24 scoped ground-truth classes matched; 0 recovered |
| Relationship recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/108 full · 0/36 scoped ground-truth relationships matched; 0 recovered (subclass/"is a" predicates excluded from both -- see README) |
| Property recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/111 full · 0/25 scoped ground-truth properties matched; 0 recovered (technical identifier/URI fields excluded — see tests/evals/README.md) |
| Controlled-value fidelity | n/a | n/a | average allowed-value overlap across matched controlled-value properties |

## Semantic (LLM-adjudicated) metrics

Same two denominators, same table shape, computed by `llmMatcher.mjs`'s `computeSemanticRecoveryMetrics()`: the heuristic pass above, plus a strict LLM judge given a second, structured look at every residual near-miss the heuristic pass rejected (a class/relationship/property phrased very differently than gold's hidden wording, or a controlled-value list using a different labeling convention for the same real scale). The judge only ever adds matches the heuristic pass missed -- it never overrides or removes a heuristic match, so this section's numbers are always >= the section above's on every recall metric. Any gap between the two sections is exactly the wording-variance tax the heuristic-only score was paying; a genuinely wrong or missing recovery costs the same in both.

| Metric | Full domain | Practical scope | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Recovery effectiveness (composite)** | **0.0%** | **0.0%** | equal-weighted: class F1, relationship F1, property F1, value fidelity |
| Class recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/68 full · 0/24 scoped ground-truth classes matched; 0 recovered |
| Relationship recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/108 full · 0/36 scoped ground-truth relationships matched; 0 recovered (subclass/"is a" predicates excluded from both -- see README) |
| Property recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/111 full · 0/25 scoped ground-truth properties matched; 0 recovered (technical identifier/URI fields excluded — see tests/evals/README.md) |
| Controlled-value fidelity | n/a | n/a | average allowed-value overlap across matched controlled-value properties |

## Rules and actions (heuristic)

Reported as their own dimensions, not folded into the recovery-effectiveness composite above (issue #105 -- a later issue can define a new composite once enough domains have been run with this data). A rule counts as recovered only when its core decision condition is semantically close to gold's, not merely its name (recoveryMetrics.mjs's `computeRuleMetrics`); an action's identification is separate from whether its input class, preconditions, effect, and verification text were also individually recovered.

| Metric | Value | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Rule recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/11 ground-truth rules matched (core condition equivalence, not name alone); 0 recovered |
| Action identification recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/11 ground-truth actions matched by name/meaning; 0 recovered |
| Action input-class accuracy | n/a | of 0 matched action(s) whose input class itself was recoverable at all |
| Action precondition recovery | n/a (no matched gold action had preconditions) | token-overlap similarity between gold rule conditions and the recovered action's own linked rules, averaged over matched actions that had any |
| Action effect recovery | n/a | token-overlap similarity between gold and recovered effect text |
| Action verification recovery | n/a | token-overlap similarity between gold and recovered verification text |

## Rules and actions (semantic)

Same shape as above, plus a strict LLM judge given a second look at every residual rule/action the heuristic pass didn't match (`llmMatcher.mjs`'s `computeSemanticRuleActionMetrics`). Input-class accuracy and precondition/effect/verification recovery are not themselves semantically re-judged -- only whether the rule/action itself counts as recovered at all is.

| Metric | Value | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Rule recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/11 ground-truth rules matched (core condition equivalence, not name alone); 0 recovered |
| Action identification recall / precision / F1 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0/11 ground-truth actions matched by name/meaning; 0 recovered |
| Action input-class accuracy | n/a | of 0 matched action(s) whose input class itself was recoverable at all |
| Action precondition recovery | n/a (no matched gold action had preconditions) | token-overlap similarity between gold rule conditions and the recovered action's own linked rules, averaged over matched actions that had any |
| Action effect recovery | n/a | token-overlap similarity between gold and recovered effect text |
| Action verification recovery | n/a | token-overlap similarity between gold and recovered verification text |

## LLM review of the conversation

## Errors

- **Turns 1–189:** The interviewer could not access or save the canvas, so none of the elicited ontology or the final validation was persisted or verified. It disclosed this limitation, but the deliverable remains unvalidated.
- **Turn 189:** Calling the *model* “known-incomplete” overstates what can be known about the saved ontology, whose contents the interviewer says it cannot inspect. The **conversational model** has known gaps; the saved model’s state is unknown.

## Noteworthy observations

- **Turns 2–99:** The interviewer carefully separated accountability, operational handling, evidence, and action authorization. It also caught important distinctions such as candidate versus verified channel impact (turns 31–33).
- **Turns 19–52, 41–43, 186:** It made representation limits explicit rather than inventing inheritance or silently merging two Alert–Incident meanings. The eventual choice of a navigable connection preserved the other meaning in notes.
- **Turns 1–188:** Repeating the canvas-access disclaimer and confirming nearly every small batch made the interview unusually long. A running decision ledger and larger batches could preserve precision with fewer turns.
- **Turns 183–188:** After the expert agreed the replay was a sound place to close, the interviewer reopened settled gaps—including the already-known recovery-point unit—and asked several more checks. These were relevant but would have fit better in one final open-issues list.

## Full conversation log

See `conversation-log.md` in this same directory (overwritten every run alongside this report). Every real apply_ontology_yaml/get_graph_state tool call's exact arguments and results are in `tool-calls.md` alongside it, for verifying any suspected tool/state-sync issue against what was actually sent and returned rather than the interviewer's own narration of it.
